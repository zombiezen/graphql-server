# Contributing to @zombiezen's GraphQL Go Server

If you're looking to contribute, first of all, thank you! :heart:

At the moment, this project is the work of just [@zombiezen][] in his spare
time. It's not currently used in production and intentionally has limited
coverage of the GraphQL specification. Particularly egregious deparatures from
the spec are called out in the [spec-compliance label][].

However, @zombiezen hopes this approach to a GraphQL library for Go will improve
the state of GraphQL server-writing in Go, and he can't do it alone. Here's how
you can help right now:

[spec-compliance label]: https://github.com/zombiezen/graphql-server/labels/spec-compliance
[@zombiezen]: https://github.com/zombiezen/

## Give feedback

Try writing a server with this library and note any issues you encounter. See if
this is a [known issue][issues], otherwise, [create a new one][new issue]. Even
if you were able to find the answer but the documentation could have been
improved, any usage feedback helps in the early stages of an API.

## Fix small issues

@zombiezen has a fairly set roadmap and prioritization of features that he is
executing upon and doesn't have time to mentor and guide someone through larger
design work at the moment. However, he'd appreciate help with certain smaller
issues along the way. These are labeled with
["good first issue"][good first issue] on the issue tracker.
